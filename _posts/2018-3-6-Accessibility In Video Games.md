title: Accessibility In Video Games
excerpt: <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moon519/moon519.github.io/master/images/ablegamers.jpg" width="400" style="float:left;margin-right:15px;"> <p> As I was traveling in Scotland a few years ago to do my second year internship at Robert Gordon University, I knew approximately nothing about accessibility in video games and I think most people and especially many game developers still don't. The idea of this placement was to develop a generic plug in that would provide accessibility features to existing games made with the Unity game engine. Considering this was only a three months placement, I worked with two others friends to make a proof of concept of the program.</p>

As I was traveling in Scotland a few years ago to do my second year internship at Robert Gordon University, I knew approximately nothing about accessibility in video games and I think most people and especially many game developers still don't.
The idea of this placement was to develop a generic plug in that would provide accessibility features to existing games made with the Unity game engine. Considering this was only a three months placement, I worked with two others friends to make a proof of concept
of the program.

I learned quite a lot about accessibility in the process and as I said, it is a under investigated topic. If you would like to know more about this, here is a list of very good reference on the subject :
* [Includification](https://www.includification.com/) Perhaps the most important resources for game developpers, this document explains how you can include accessibility features in your game.
* [Able Gamers Foundation](http://www.ablegamers.org/) self explanatory.


To sum up the key points, if you are not convinced you should read more :
* According to the able gamers foundation, it is estimated over one billion people have some form of a disability worldwide, and around 33 million gamers with disabilities so there is a market.
* "That moment when you realise that your craft isnâ€™t just about entertainment, that you have the opportunity to make a real difference to people, to help change things for the better - it makes a difference to why you get out of bed in the morning." - Ian Hamilton, from the guide above.
* Some accessibility features are VERY easy to implement and could enhance all player experience : key remapping, mouse sensitivity...


Now let's talk a bit about the work we did for this project. We ended up with different features and helpers for different type of disabilities :
* Visual helpers : for people who have trouble with contrasts, we provided two post effect shaders : an edge detection and a contrast enhancer one. We also made post effect for different type of color blindness, and you should too.
* Hearing disabilities : this one was more difficult to imagine since it depends heavily on the game and the implementation. We ended up with a little script listening to all the sounds being played in the scene and displaying
subtitles for each one in the lower part of the screen. We also made different sliders to allow the player to mute any sound they want in the game.
* Mechanical helpers : some people have problem with 'jiterring' and have trouble using the keyboard or the mouse. We tried to implement a 'double striking filter' that ignores some of the player's input to keep the game smooth.
Since Unity does not provide key remapping out of the box, we also developed a small utility to do that as an example.

Of course, each of these thing depends on the game you are making but the point is that it is very likely to be easy to integrate a few in your game, and you should consider it. Source code is available on github, but I would advise just
testing the game and seeing what was done - the code is not going to help you a lot since it's quite simple. Feel free to use nonetheless if you want to.
