I just finished my last year of master's degree in Computer Graphics at Lyon, France. I am now a Research Engineer at LIRIS, working with
the Geomod Team on procedural generation of landscapes. My areas of research include modeling of volumetric phenomena such as terrains, caves
or breaking waves. 

I will be blogging about my research, personal projects and whatever comes to my mind. I am also a part time teacher and love to help, so feel 
free to contact me if you have any question. [axel.paris69@gmail.com](mailto:axel.paris69@gmail.com)
