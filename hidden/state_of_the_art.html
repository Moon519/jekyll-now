	<a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/eric.galin/Articles/2015-terrain-from-primitives.pdf">2015 - Génevaux - Terrain Modeling from Feature Primitives</a><br>
	<p>
		Introduce a hierarchical tree representation for 2D terrains composed of compact features primitives (noise-based mostly), and operators aggregating their subtrees. Inspired by the BlobTree and 
		noise-based terrains introduced by Musgrave. The compact terrains can be visualized by either a high-quality mesh extraction or sphere tracing. This paper also shows some Lipschitz constant computation
		for several node in the tree.<br>
		Each terrain primitive comes with two functions: an elevation function and a weight function. The main difficulty resides in combining efficiently the primitives together and keeping tracks of the weight of
		every primitives or sub tree in the scene. Overall, a nice and efficient model which would benefit from an interactive editor to create custom heightmaps. Lots of work could be done on the primitives themselves
		to create interesting, parameterized features.<br>
		<b>Pros:</b><br>
			-Can virtually represent any 2D features<br>
			-Compact, memory efficient model<br>
		<b>Cons:</b><br>
			-Weight functions to combine primitives are difficult to control.<br>
			-Visualization is not straightforward - the model is an implicit tree.<br>		
		<b>Future Work:</b><br>
			-Interactive editor to place the primitives and create custom heightfields<br>
			-New primitives to represent different features, like coastlines.

	<a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/eric.guerin/download/eg2016.pdf">2016 - Guérin - Sparse representation of terrains for procedural modeling</a><br>
	<p>
		<b> TODO: read in much more detail the paper since there is a LOT of information in it.</b><br>
		Introduce a sparse representation for 2D terrains based on a dictionnary composed of atoms representing landforms features. Theses features can be either from DEM or procedural primitives.
		The framework has several interesting applications: inverse modeling, amplification, synthesis from a user sketch. It can also be used for terrain compression, storing few landforms as images 
		and procedural primitives as compact functions. The notion of hiearchy is not very clear since only blending is used between the primitives. <br>
		The atoms are computed with Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), the dictionnary learning is done with a K-SVD.<br>
		<b>Pros:</b><br>
			-Lots of possible applications for this method<br>
			-Novelty: this is a new representation for terrains<br>
		<b>Cons:</b><br>
			-Too much information in the paper - it could have been easily splitted in two, showing various application for the model.<br>
			-The method produce coherent large scale details, but lacks consistency on smaller scales.<br>
		<b>Future Work:</b><br>
			-Focus on the compression side - showing a real time visualization of huge terrains (GPU)<br>
			-Find a way to combine erosion method with the sparse representation: erode the atoms locally ? Store the differences/the erosion as an analytic functions ?

	<a href="http://hpcg.purdue.edu/bbenes/papers/Benes01SCCG.pdf">2001 - Benes - Layered Data Representation for Visual Simulation of Terrain Erosion</a><br>
	<p>
		First introduced the layered representation for terrains, therefore improving the thermal erosion algorithm to better show the interaction between layers. The paper is 
		oriented toward technical contributions more than mathematicals, and some parallelization was planned.
	</p>
	
	<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00207679/document">2008 - Bruneton - Real time rendering and editing of vector based terrains</a><br>
	<p>
		This paper seems very complicated in the implementation since it can represent many features: rivers, road, lakes, fields etc... With user control, on large terrain with an adaptative quadtree.
		However, since the code is provided by Eric Bruneton, it is much simpler to implement the techniques described in the paper.<br>
		Overall, the contributions are very technical oriented - it seems that there was no real challenge on the scientific side of things. Reimplementing this paper could take months.

	<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.462.5969&rep=rep1&type=pdf">2005 - Farès - Modeling Landscapes with Ridges and Rivers</a><br>
	<p>
		Introduces an original method to generate a set of ridge line and river network. It uses a particle system to choose the futur ridge and river path and displace the terrain all along.
		The terrains with the ridge lines and river is amplified with a Midpoint displacement and inverse midpoint displacement algorithm, which I don't know. The resulting landscapes are much 
		better than simple fractal noises, but lacks interesting features apart from the ridges and rivers. The midpoint adds details but not an interesting one. The method also seems to fit in 
		the user controlled category with the last images - a surrealistic landscape model. Still, this paper would be interesting to implement.<br>
		<b>Future Work:</b><br>
			-Try a different amplification method and see the results.

	<h3>Volumetric Terrains</h3>
	<a href="https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/adrien.peytavie/publications/articles/EG2009_ArchesAFrameworkModelingComplexTerrains.pdf">2009 - Peytavie - Arches: a Framework for Modeling Complex Terrains</a><br>
	<p>
		Introduce a novel framework to represent volumetric terrains, capable of modeling overhangs, arches and caves. It uses a hybrid representation between voxels and implicit surfaces, and relies on manual editing
		to create the features, despite having some erosion and stabilization algorithm presented in the PhD thesis of Adrien.<br>
		<b>Pros:</b><br>
			-The results are very good looking with a good texturing.<br>
			-A novel representation at the time, "memory efficient".<br>
			-Multi layer representation with sand and bedrock as well.<br>
		<b>Cons:</b><br>
			-Still not capable of representing large terrains<br>
			-The paper doesn't describe the erosion algorithms at all. Look at the PhD thesis of Adrien to learn more.
	</p>
	
	<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2948853_Procedural_Landscapes_with_Overhangs">2001 - Gamito - Procedural Landscapes with Overhangs</a><br>
	<p>
		Introduce a global warping operator along a fractal field to create interesting overhangs on an cliff-like terrain. The method can also be applied to model breaking waves at different life stages.
		This is one of the very few paper that can do two completely separate things with a single model. The rendering was also quite good at the time.
	</p>
	
	<a href="/biblio/1993 - Roudier - Landscapes Synthesis through Erosion and Simulation.pdf">1993 - Roudier - Landscapes Synthesis through Erosion and Simulation</a><br>
	<p>
		This paper, despite being old, introduce a new way to perform erosion based on a 3D geological model, describing various rock materials with different erosion properties.
		The method itself was not that interesting (I guess ?) but the idea of a geological model guiding the simulation/generation was new. The results are difficult to measure because of 
		the age of the paper.
	</p>
	
	<a href="/biblio/2018 - Becher - Feature Based Volumetric Terrain Generation and Decoration.pdf">2018 - Becher - Feature Based Volumetric Terrain Generation and Decoration</a><br>
	<p>
		<b>The concept of "Decoration" in the Journal paper must be investigated a bit more</b><br>
		The paper extends the concept of Feature Curve introduced by Hnaidi in 2010 on 2D terrains to Volumetric Terrains. It relies on a voxel structure to represent the curves and reconstruct the final
		mesh to visualize. Curves are made entirely by user sketching (which is not described) and not generated by a custom method. The whole method has been implemented on the GPU and timings are provided 
		for every stage of the pipeline.<br>
		Terrain sizes are not specified - but judging by the pictures, I am guessing the resolution is at least 1m for the smallest features. Considering this, the provided timings are not really good in my opinion,
		but the method seems controllable and extendes on the well-known concept of the Feature Curve.<br>
		<b>Pros:</b><br>
			-Extends the Feature Curves<br>
			-The results are visually goods and convincing<br>
			-There is not a lot of work on Volumetric Terrains, so it is always good to have a new journal paper.<br>
		<b>Cons:</b> <br>
			-Timings are not that good<br>
			-Terrain don't seem very large - a few hundred meter at best.<br>
		<b>Future Work:</b><br>
			-I don't see much more work being done with this concept. It is a nice tool for artists for Voxel Terrains though.<br>
			-Maybe take the concept of 3D feature curves and make it with the implicit representation... To compare the results, which should be much better.
	</p>
	
	<a href="/biblio/2018 - Dey - Procedural Feature Generation for Volumetric Terrains using Voxel Grammars.pdf">2018 - Dey - Procedural Feature Generation for Volumetric Terrains using Voxel Grammars</a><br>
	<p>
		This paper doesn't have a lot of interest. It presents some Voxel Grammars method to generate volumetric features, but the results are not very convincing and I think the concept of Voxel Grammars is not 
		new at all. I can imagine this working quite well but the results shown are just not convincing enough.
		<b>Pros:</b> <br>
			-It should work.<br>
		<b>Cons:</b> <br>
			-Nothing very new.<br>
			-Results are not convincing.<br>
		<b>Future Work:</b> <br>
			-It would be interesting to try to redo this work and get better results, for the sake of trying and comparing methods.
	</p>
	
	<a href="/biblio/2015 - caves-procedural.pdf">2015 - Procedural Generation of Caves on the GPU</a><br>
	<p>
		As opposed to the previous paper, the results shown here are more convincing. A demo and the code is also available on the web (I think ?). The concept is to create the caves outlines with a L-system
		and then to carve the voxel structure with a warped metaball. The caves are then populated with objects such as stalactite and stalagmite whose distribution is computed according to some noise function.
		The work done on the shading part is also quite nice, despite not being a technical contribution to the paper. The authors also conducted a user study to evaluate the realism of the generated cave networks.
		As the code and a demo is provided, reproducing the work would not be very interesting I think.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Generation</h3>
	<a href="https://arches.liris.cnrs.fr/publications/articles/SIGGRAPH2013_PCG_Terrain.pdf">2013 - Génevaux - Terrain Generation Using Procedural Models Based on Hydrology</a><br>
	<p>
		Novel terrain generation technique, based on hydrology inspired rules. First generate a river network graph, then divide the space into Voronoi cells an determine which feature primitive will be placed.
		The method is rather complex et should be implemented carefully to understand the pipeline. Some technical aspects might take some time. The results show interesting terrains with good river networks but
		the mountains are very hill-shaped. There should be some ridges as well as hills and rivers. The generated terrains are also rather big.
		<b>Pros:</b> <br>
			-A Novel method to generate terrains with a correct hydrologic network.<br>
			-Introduce the feature primitives method as well.<br>
		<b>Cons:</b> <br>
			-Might be technically difficult to implement<br>
			-Ridges are non-existent, mostly due to missing information about the locations and because there was no ridge primitive.
	</p>
	
	<a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01262376/document">2016 - Cordonnier - Large Scale Terrain Generation from Tectonic Uplift and Fluvial Erosion</a><br>
	<p>
		This paper focuses on the generation of large-scale terrain made by two processes: Tectonic Uplift (with an uplift map) and Fluvial Erosion (StreamPower Erosion). The algorithms work on a vector-based
		representation and must then be visualized with feature primitives or a smooth gaussian elevation (interpolation ?). The method produces very interesting shapes depending on the uplift map provided by the user.
		The paper seems to use several tricks to ensure that moutains remains good looking. Some very steep cliffs can be seens in the results as well.
	</p>
	
	<a href="https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01518967/document">2017 - Cordonnier - Authoring Landscapes by Combining Ecosystem and Terrain Erosion Simulation</a><br>
	<p>
		Introduce a rather complicated framework that simulates lots of effects between multiple materials: ground, water, vegetation, rocks... The events are coherent and temporally bounded between multiple frames.
		Examples of events: lightning, gravity, forest fire, running water and temperature. The system also allows user control at different stage of the pipeline.
		<b>Pros:</b> <br>
			-A Novel method to simulate interconnected events and extract a terrain.<br>
			-Very cool research theme.<br>
		<b>Cons:</b> <br>
			-Technically difficult to implement: parallelization is not trivial because of the interconnection and temporal overlap between events.<br>
			-Fine-scale details are not represented, the simulation stays at a large scale and piles of rocks might have been manually placed by the user.
