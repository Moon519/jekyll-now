	<h2>Terrain Erosion on the GPU #2</h2>

	In my <a class="aUnderlined" href="terrain_erosion.html">previous post</a> on thermal erosion, I implemented the naive, straightforward 
	version of the algorithm which can be summarized as this: for every cell <i>C</i>, check the stability in regards to its neighbours. 
	If <i>C</i> is unstable, distribute a certain amount of material to downwards neighbours.
	<br><br>
	The problem with this approach in a massively parallel context is the need to write to neighboring cells, which
	requires slow atomic operations. However, for several algorithms, what often works is to reverse the thinking: instead
	of trying to write to neighboring cells, change the method to <i>read</i> from neighbours and <i>only write</i> to
	the current cell, therefore avoiding costly atomic operations and race conditions.
	<br><br>
	By chance, this method can be applied to thermal erosion. The idea for a single cell <i>C</i> is to look for upward points that 
	will be giving matter to <i>C</i> and do the operation (here, adding matter) on <i>C</i> only. Same thing for the distribution to 
	downward cells: we remove matter from <i>C</i> only, and let the neighboring cells do the other part of the computation. This has
	to be done with two buffer to make sure to get a deterministic output. Here is the revised version of the algorithm in a compute
	shader:<br><br>
	
	<br>
	This method can generally be applied to other erosion algorithms, such as hydraulic or aeolian erosion.
	Here is a performance comparison of the method described in this post versus the one from the 
	<a class="aUnderlined" href="terrain_erosion.html">previous post</a>:
	<br><br>
	The new method outperforms the one from the previous post and has no race condition.
